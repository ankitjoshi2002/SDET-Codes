******************   Behavior Driven Development - BDD    ******************

it is a popular black box technique to do automation testing.
we are gonna use java based framework i.e. Cucumber to implement BDD


In this (dot).features we gonna write the behaviors (business analyst writes the behavior)

the behavior are written using GHERKIN language

The Gherkin language revolves are the following keywords:

1. Given - A precondition
Eg: given user on login page

2. When - An action/ set of actions
Eg: When user types correct username and incorrect password

3. And - is a Conjunction (join two separate actions)
Eg: And user clicks login button

4. Or
5. But

6.Then - An outcome to be validates
Eg: Then user lands on welcome page

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business analyst writes BDD and give it to Testers
Then Testers write test cases to each behavior and give it to Developer

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: create  a Maven Project
Step 2: Group Id -> com.coforge.bdd
Step 3: Artifcat Id -> DemoBDD

Step 4: RightCick on src/test/Java --> Create pacakage com.coforge.steps
Step 5: RightCick on src/test/java --> create package com.coforge.runner

Step 6: Create a folder named - MyAppFeatures --> Rightclick on project(DemoBDD) and create new project

Step 7: Rightclick on MyAppFeatures -> and create Login.feature file

*****
In pom.xml ---> we add dependencies
go to maven repository and type cucumber(io.cucumber)
cucumber-java  (take same version of each)
cucumber-junit (take same version of each)
cucumber-core  (take same version of each)
selenium-java

#Sample Feature Definition Template
@tag
Feature: Title of your feature
  I want to use this template for my feature file

  @tag1
  Scenario: Title of your scenario
    Given I want to write a step with precondition
    And some other precondition
    When I complete action
    And some other action
    And yet another action
    Then I validate the outcomes
    And check more outcomes

  @tag2
  Scenario Outline: Title of your scenario outline
    Given I want to write a step with <name>
    When I check for the <value> in step
    Then I verify the <status> in step

    Examples: 
      | name  | value | status  |
      | name1 |     5 | success |
      | name2 |     7 | Fail    |
